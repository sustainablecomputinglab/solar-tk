# Solar-TK: A Data-driven Toolkit for Solar Performance Modeling and Forecasting

Solar-TK is a data-driven toolkit for solar performance modeling and forecasting that is simple, extensible,and publicly accessible. Solar-TK’s simple approach models and forecasts a site’s solar output given only its location and a small amount of historical generation data. Solar- TK’s extensible design includes a small collection of independent modules that connect together to implement basic modeling and forecasting, while also enabling users to implement new energy analytics. 

A key goal of Solar-TK is to be simple to use by researchers that require realistic and accurate solar performance models and forecasts, but are not experts in these areas.

## Why do we need a toolkit for solar performance modeling and forecasting?

We quote our [Solar-TK paper](http://www.ecs.umass.edu/~irwin/solartk.pdf)
explaining the need for a toolkit:

  > Much of the research work on solar performance modeling and forecasting
  > is not accessible to researchers outside the area, either because it has not 
  > been implemented and released as open source, is too complex and time-consuming to 
  > re-implement, or requires access to proprietary data. 

## What does Solar-TK offer? 

To address the problem, we present Solar-TK, an open data-driven toolkit for solar performance modeling and forecasting that is simple, extensible, and publicly accessible. A key goal of Solar-TK is to be simple to use by researchers that require realistic and accurate solar performance models and forecasts, but are not experts in these areas.
Solar-TK includes:

-  a dataset of solar power generation and energy consumption across hudreds of homes
-  a module to estimate the physical specifications of a solar site, i.e. capacity, tilt, orientation
-  a module to estimate the maximum generation potential of a solar site
-  a module to estimate the weather-adjusted generation for a solar site
-  a module to adjust the estimated output for shading by nearby buildings and trees (will be added in future)
-  a module providing metrics used in solar modeling and forecasting (will be added in future)
